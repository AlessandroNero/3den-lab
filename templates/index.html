    <h2>How DNA is Transformed into Music:</h2>
    <p>
        The process of converting DNA sequences into music is fascinating and involves a translation of genetic material into musical elements.
    </p>
    <h3>1. Binary to DNA</h3>
    <p>
        In the first step, binary data (0s and 1s) is converted into DNA. This is done by mapping pairs of bits to the four DNA bases: Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G), and Thymine (T). For example, "00" becomes A, "01" becomes C, "10" becomes G, and "11" becomes T.
    </p>

    <h3>2. DNA to Music</h3>
    <p>
        The DNA sequence is then mapped into musical notes. Each of the four bases (A, C, G, T) is associated with a musical note: 
        - A = Do
        - C = Re
        - G = Mi
        - T = Fa.
    </p>
    <p>
        These notes are then used to create a musical melody. Each sequence of DNA, once translated, forms the structure for the music, where each base determines the pitch.
    </p>

    <h3>3. MIDI to DNA</h3>
    <p>
        In the reverse process, MIDI data representing musical notes can be converted back to DNA. This is done by reading specific notes and mapping them back to the DNA bases.
    </p>
    <p>
        - Do ‚Üí A
        - Re ‚Üí C
        - Mi ‚Üí G
        - Fa ‚Üí T
    </p>
    <p>
        The MIDI file contains these notes, and by identifying them, we can recreate the DNA sequence that generated the melody.
